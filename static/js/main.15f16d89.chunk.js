The study of infectious diseases is based on the theory and method of infectious disease dynamics (Hans Modeling infectious disease 2015). The idea behind infectious disease dynamics is to build a  mathematical model that can reflect the spread process, spread law, and trend of infectious diseases. Its advantage is that, according to the characteristics of infectious diseases, the model of infectious diseases if reasonably assumed, the appropriate parameters are set, and the appropriate variables are selected. Then, we can easily understand the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases.One such parameter of controlling spread which people neglect is the living conditions of people.
